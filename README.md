## About the Fork

After multiple desperate tries of installing the package and much dependency hell and (as it kept installing me an older version of the package every time), I decided to fork just to fix the dependencies or issues I face with this package.

This package is made for those **who know what they're doing.** The rest of the installation or packages should be dealt with by yourself normally.
This package is not meant for overall public use, but simply for me to use and those who might have the same specific issues I have.

**I will therefore not manage any related issues towards this package.**

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/realcoloride/FixedRealtimeSTT.git

```

Original package: https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT
