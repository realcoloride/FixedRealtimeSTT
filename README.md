*Easy-to-use, low-latency speech-to-text library for realtime applications*

## About the Fork

After multiple desperate tries of installing the package and much dependency hell and (as it kept installing me an older version of the package every time), I decided to fork just to fix the dependencies or issues I face with this package.

This package is made for those **who know what they're doing.** The rest of the installation or packages should be dealt with by yourself normally.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/realcoloride/FixedRealtimeSTT.git

```

Original package: https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT
